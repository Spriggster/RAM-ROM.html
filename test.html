    <p class="RAM" class="ROM">The terms "RAM" and "ROM" refer to two types of computer data storage. RAM is an acronym for "random access memory," While ROM stands for "read-only memory. "RAM is a type of volatile memory. Data in RAM is not permanently written. When you power off your computer the data stored in RAM is deleted. ROM is a type of non- volatile memory. Data in ROM is permanently written and is not erased when you power off your computer.<br><br> So basicly RAM is memory for stuff that doesn't get saved and the less important stuff like running instructions for the computer to do, ROM since its prewritten does more important jobs like running the program that boots up the computer 
More RAM equals better work for the RAM and more ROM means more memory to work with.

    <p> RAM and ROM are worth a pretty penny if you're not smart when online shopping. What usually make a good RAM and ROM is their compatibility with your parts or the ones your upgrading to when buying a good RAM or ROM card, if they're not compatitable you just wasted your money.<br><br> Also obviously a good inducator on if the RAM/ROM is a good is how much memory they have, If your already have a card and its running out of space before sinking a few hundred on a new RAM card try getting the most out of your old one.<br> <br> If you're sticking to a budget build for you PC around 300$, I would say that the cheapsest RAM sticks go for around 25 Dollars for around 4 GB unless you buy two which usually people get. For an example the <a href="https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA8X636M1549&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwordsCAMKPL-PC&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwordsCAMKPL-PC-_-pla-_-Memory+%28System+Specific+Memory%29-_-9SIA8X636M1549&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzuLtiLa32QIVzrbACh0qVQuQEAQYASABEgLFT_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">NEMIX RAM 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR2 </a> is 25$ RAM stick that comes with 2 cards that are both 4GB. Top end RAM cards can go for 500+ Dollars if you aren't on a budget and can spend 500+ dollar the <a href="https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820236252&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwordsCA-PC&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwordsCA-PC-_-pla-_-Memory+%28Desktop+Memory%29-_-N82E16820236252&gclid=EAIaIQobChMImJ60ueC52QIVWLXACh2mwQncEAYYASABEgLZl_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds"> Corsair Vengeance LPX 32 GB (2 x 16GB)</a> is a great card for any PC elitist that comes 2-16 GB cards allowing you a impressive 32GB jump in memory. Lastly a Good RAM card has good speed (MHz) which basicly means how much memory can transfer in a computer cycle. </p>
