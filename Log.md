# Things I have learn't
I really learned a lot about PC building how to be on a budget when looking for RAM cards and then 
what a person with a lot of money to spend on their PC would look for. The terminlogy I learned was cool like Voltile memory and (MHs)
and how a PC functions with (and without ROM and RAM). I explored the internet for the best deals on cards and the most overpriced cards.
I never felt board when researching and I always found cool new info to learn about ROM and RAM in general. At the end I learned about,
Graphics cards, OS, Power systems, ECT and how they all come together to make a wonderful computer whole.

# Things I still want to learn
Well honestly I have so  many more questions, they aren't very important but here we go. I would like to know about cooling systems,
I.T, Cases, USBs, brands, repairing tips, Budget builds and general computer maintance.
